            is not the operation of subject but rather an affirmation of an idea
            in mind. It is not us who affirms something of a thing in our mind
            but rather it is the thing that affirms something of itself in our
            mind. <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowledge is unfolding of an idea in the same sense as effect is an
            unfolding of cause.

            <li><b>Knowledge</b> - affirmation of an idea in mind.</li>
            <li><b>Consciousness</b> - reduplication of an idea.</li>

        <h2>Kinds of Knowledge</h2>

        <section class="maintext">
          <h4>First Kind of Knowledge</h4>
          <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/spino-ep/#H3" class="link"
            >First kind of knowledge</a
          >
          is defined by equivocal signs that can be divided into
          <b>indicative</b> signs that imply inadequate knowledge of things and
          <b>imperative</b> signs that involve inadequate knowledge of laws.<br /><br />

          <h4>Second Kind of Knowledge</h4>
          <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/spino-ep/#H4" class="link"
            >Second kind of knowledge</a
          >
          is defined by <b>common notions</b> that is by shared composition of
          relations. It is an effort of reason to organize encounters among
          modes in accordance to the relations in which they agree with one
          another. From this kind of knowledge follow active affects that either
          surpass or replace the previous passive affects.<br /><br />

          Common notions are not abstract ideas in the sense of abstracting
          certain aspects and reifying them as separate. They are general ideas
          insofar as they are based on shared relations or relations of
          agreement among multitudes and thereby lack knowledge of singular
          essences.<br /><br />

          <h4>Third Kind of Knowledge</h4>
          <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/spino-ep/#H5" class="link"
            >Third kind of knowledge</a
          >
          is defined by direct knowledge of essences. This is no longer the
          knowledge through common compositions of relations but rather through
          the internal differences of intensity.
